But if you want to achieve high quality, you have to implement it in your production code.\n\nHere’s how I correctly implemented this."

And then I write the code for the function that will call the function that will be tested by the test. And then I can realize that this is stupid, so I delete everything.

And we are all trying to get the attention of our target clients and prospects. But how do you create an audience on LinkedIn? First, you need to stop worrying about the followers. You can't buy them on LinkedIn, like you can on Facebook or Twitter. You need to focus on creating quality content. And you need to do it often. Because the thing is, if people find value in your content, they will share it with others. And then others will see your content. And if your content is good and valuable, they will follow you. Let me tell you a story that"

The strategy would work in many social networks, but I find LinkedIn particularly useful to create an audience. Let me tell you why ... ‍If you like to read and learn new things, you're a good candidate to write interesting content that can create an audience.\n\nThe only thing you'll need is consistency. It's rare for anyone to find your profile and connect with you. The chances are low, so you need to do it on your own. ‍Find your niche and the type of content that works for you. Also, make your posts valuable for your readers by adding valuable information and resources: articles, videos,"

After some time, I noticed that my posts were not very successful. Today, I use a different strategy: I always ask myself who is my target and what he wants ... Result?

LinkedIn is the ideal network to connect with people in your industry: that's why you should never leave it.
